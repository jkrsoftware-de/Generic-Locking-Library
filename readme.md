### The underlying Software-License.
This Software is free forever.

There is nothing to pay and nothing to fulfill, to use/edit/(re-)publish my written Software-Code.

## About the „Entity Locking“-Libraries.
I'm developing the Entity Locking-Libraries, cause in many of my current (and future) Software-Products, I need an 
easy Way to lock Entities, such as:
* Payment-Transactions for Reality.
* Payment-Transactions for own Gaming-Platforms.
* virtual Bank-Accounts for own Gaming-Platforms.
* User-Accounts

and so on.

The Entity-Locking-Libraries providing me (and potentially all other Humans) an easy-
(to-use/to-implement/to-understand) Way for to solve this Problem.

If you want to switch your Lock-Backend, you easily switch to another Variant of the Libraries.

Every Library (except of the Root-Library itself) is depending on the Generic-„Locking Library“.

All other Libraries are Abstractions to have a better understanding for the Outside-World and to have a good 
Foundation for further Development-Approaches.

## Why should I use one of these Libraries?
It's very easy to implement in your Application and easy to understand.

You can have an Entity-Locking-Solution right out of the Box for (currently) _Plain Java_ and _Spring Boot-optimized_ 
Apps.
