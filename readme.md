## ðŸ“• About all of my Software-Products.
Just read the following Paragraphs. ðŸ˜Š

---

### ðŸ“ƒ I use the â€žPorts & Adaptersâ€œ- / â€žHexagonalâ€œ-Software-Design.
For every newly-created Software, I use the **â€žPorts & Adaptersâ€œ-Design**.

For better understanding â€” what the **â€žPorts & Adaptersâ€œ-Design** is â€” have a look here: [Wikipedia (EN) Â· Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software))

### ðŸ“ƒ The underlying Software-License.
This Software is free forever.

There is nothing to pay and nothing to fulfill, to use/to edit/to (re-)publish my written Software-Code.

*You can also have a look at: [license.md](license.md) in the same Directory.*

## ðŸ“™ About the â€žEntity Lockingâ€œ-Libraries.
I'm developing the Entity Locking-Libraries, cause in many of my current (and future) Software-Products, I need an 
easy Way to lock Entities, such as:
* Payment-Transactions for Reality.
* Payment-Transactions for own Gaming-Platforms.
* virtual Bank-Accounts for own Gaming-Platforms.
* User-Accounts

and so on.

The **Entity-Locking-Libraries** providing me (and potentially all other Humans) an **easy-(to-use/to-implement/to-understand) Way** to solve this Problem. :)

If you want to **switch your Lock-Backend**, you can easily switch to **another Abstraction-Variant of the Locking-Library**.

Every Library (except of the Root-Library itself) is depending on the â€žGeneric-Locking-Libraryâ€œ.

**Why didn't I put everything just in one Library? :)**
<br />
This Expansion/Extension-Library-Concept was my first thought.
<br />
I loved this Idea.

I decided to design/develop the Libraries in this Way, cause:
* the Expandability/Understandability is much higher for the Outside-World
* and I've a good Foundation for further Development-Approaches.<br />
  Don't need to update the Core-Library, if I only want to develop a new Implementation.

### ðŸ“ƒ Why should I use one of these Libraries?
It's very easy to implement in your Application and easy to understand.

You can have an **Entity-Locking-Solution** right out of the Box for (currently) **_Plain Java_** and
**_Spring Boot-optimized_** Apps.

The Generic-Locking-Library is the Foundation of every Locking-Library developed by me.

You can use the **Generic-Locking-Library** in Combination with your own Lock-Backend-Implementation â€” or â€” you use my Implementations, in the Form of Extension-Libraries, such as:
* **DynamoDB-Locking-Library**
  * for _Spring Boot_-Apps: *DynamoDB-Locking-Library-SpringBoot-Starter*
* (coming soon) the **Redis-Locking-Library**
    * for _Spring Boot_-Apps: *Redis-Locking-Library-SpringBoot-Starter*
