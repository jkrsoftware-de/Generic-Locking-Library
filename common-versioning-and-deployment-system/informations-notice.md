# ðŸ’¬ Informations about the â€žVersioning and Deployment-Systemâ€œ

"*Jerry, what is the â€žVersioning- and Deployment-Systemâ€œ?* someone may would ask me.

The Versioning- and Deployment-System is a Bundle of Bash-Scripts, helping me to introduce a simple Approach of 
Versioning and Deployment to my Projects via GitLab-CI.

It's easy to expandable / adjustable for me.

Later I maybe would do an independent Release of this Script-Bundle as an own Software-Product.<br />
Currently it's only considered for my own Purposes.<br />
That doesn't mean, you can't use it right away â€” but this Bundle isn't optimized for a Public-Release.

You can ask me, if you need help. ðŸ˜Š<br />
You'll find my Contact-Informations on the Readme-Page.
